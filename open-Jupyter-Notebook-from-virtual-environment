Open Jupyter Notebook from virtual environment :
After activating the virtual environment run this from the virtual env folder:
  * python -m pip install ipykernel - even if virtual environment got installed with system packages included (with ipykernel installed)
  * ipython kernel install --user --name=.venv
  * then load jupyter notebook normally
  * then open new notebook by selecting the virtual environment kernel

If packages cannot be loaded, make sure the kernel.json file in the kernel's path points to the virtual env's python. E.g.: C:\Users\rcisar\AppData\Roaming\jupyter\kernels\.venv
